- Appreciate features like detailed task postings, secure payments, and real-time updates on task progress.  

**Example Use Cases:**  
1. A student needs help picking up an official letter from the Mahallah Office and delivering it to their dorm room.  
2. A student requests someone to book a venue at their Kulliyyah Office on their behalf due to overlapping commitments.  
3. A student needs items, such as snacks or toiletries, purchased and delivered from the Sri Gombak convenience store.
