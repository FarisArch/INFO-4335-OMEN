### Target Audience
### 1. Errand Customers  
Errand customers are students who need tasks or errands completed but may not have the time or resources to do them themselves. These errands can range from simple tasks, like picking up documents from an office, to more specific requests, such as booking venues or purchasing items from nearby stores.  

**Key Characteristics:**  
- Busy with academic or personal commitments and need help managing daily errands.  
- May not have access to transportation or the ability to travel frequently around campus or nearby areas.  
- Require a simple, reliable, and affordable solution to delegate tasks efficiently.  
- Appreciate features like detailed task postings, secure payments, and real-time updates on task progress.  

**Example Use Cases:**  
1. A student needs help picking up an official letter from the Mahallah Office and delivering it to their dorm room.  
2. A student requests someone to book a venue at their Kulliyyah Office on their behalf due to overlapping commitments.  
3. A student needs items, such as snacks or toiletries, purchased and delivered from the Sri Gombak convenience store.  


### 2.Errand Runners  
Errand runners are students who take on tasks posted by errand customers. They aim to earn extra income, gain experience, or simply help their peers. The app acts as a platform to connect them with available jobs based on their preferences and availability.  

**Key Characteristics:**  
- Students who have flexible schedules and are looking for part-time opportunities or side income.  
- Tech-savvy individuals who can navigate the app efficiently to browse, filter, and accept tasks.  
- Motivated by convenience, proximity of tasks, and fair payment options.  
- May leverage the app to build a reputation through customer reviews, increasing their chances of securing more tasks.  

**Example Use Cases:**  
1. A student who has time between classes accepts tasks like printing documents for others at a nearby printing shop or campus facility.  
2. A student accepts tasks for booking venues or appointments at Kulliyyah Offices, especially for those unfamiliar with the process.  
3. A student with a car who often commutes to areas like Sri Gombak takes requests to buy and deliver items from convenience stores, offering reliable service for errands outside campus.
   
### Benefits for Both Groups  
- **Errand Customers:** Save time and effort while ensuring their tasks are completed quickly and securely.
